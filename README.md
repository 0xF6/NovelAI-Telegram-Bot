## Database

In config:
```yaml
Database:
  Firestore:
    IsActive: false
    ConnectionString: ProjectId://nai
    CredentialPath: 
  LiteDB:
    IsActive: true
    ConnectionString: nai.db
```

By default bot use litedb but you can enable firestore, at the moment it has not been tested sufficiently

## About formulas

```yaml
CrystallFormula: "round((map([step], 1, 50, [minAnlas], [maxAnlas]) + map([quality], 4096, 3145728, 2, 136)) / 2)"
EnhanceFormula: "round(price + (price * 0.6))"
VariationFormula: "price * 3"
SeedFormula: "l(0, pow(2, 32) - 1)"
```

You can set custom formula for calculation price and seed


## About authorization

For now, bot required authToken from devtools        
Do auth in novelai.net, press F12, go to Application/Local Storage/Session and copy value of `auth_token`
